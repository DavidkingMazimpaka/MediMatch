# MediMatch Rwanda - ML Model for Medication Availability

## Overview

MediMatch Rwanda is designed to alleviate the challenges patients in Rwanda face in accessing prescribed medications. By leveraging advanced AI and ML methodologies, we aim to create a platform that ensures patients can quickly and reliably find pharmacies with their required medications or suitable alternatives in stock.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:
- **Data Collection**: Gathering data on pharmacy locations, medication inventory, and prescription patterns.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for model training.
- **Model Training**: Developing and training ML models to predict medication availability.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models.
