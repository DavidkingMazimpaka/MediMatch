# MediMatch Rwanda - ML Model for Drug Name Detection

## Overview

MediMatch Rwanda is designed to alleviate the challenges patients in Rwanda face in accessing prescribed medications. By leveraging advanced AI and ML methodologies, we aim to create a platform that ensures patients can quickly and reliably find pharmacies with their required medications or suitable alternatives in stock, but for now It has first with developed an ML model for Drug Name Detection.

## ML Model for Drug Name Detection Summary

The Drug Name Detection dataset serves as a fundamental resource for training and evaluating computer vision models in the field of drug name detection. Comprising a diverse collection of 1823 images, this dataset aims to facilitate the development of accurate and robust object detection models specifically tailored for drug label analysis.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:
- **Data Collection**: Gathering data on pharmacy locations, medication inventory, and prescription patterns.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for model training.
- **Model Training**: Developing and training ML models to predict medication availability.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
